# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

 Software Engineering is an engineering approach to software development

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 

Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems. 

It differs from tradiotional programming due to it involving the design,development, testing,deployment, and maintenance of software products while traditional programming involves defining every step and condition therfore leaving no room for the system to learn or adapt independently.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.

Design : Creating high-level and detailed design of the software architecture and user interface.

Implementation: Writing code and building the sofyware according to the design specifications.

Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functinal requirements.

Development: Releasing the software to users or customers.

Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Agile: Iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration,and responding to change.
Waterfall:Sequential approach with distinct phases such as design,requirements, and implementation.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?

While agile is a flexible,iterative approach to software development,it requires continuous improvement because it carries out short-term development cycles and is preferred due to faster implementation of changes and better communication with users and greater user satisfaction. Waterfall is a sequential development with each phase completely wrapping up before the next phase begins and has a clear structure with well-defined goals and deliveries. Therefore it is easy to manage this type ofproject.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.

Requirements Engineering refers to the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements in the engineering design.
It is important and critical to the success of a project because its clear on what needs to be done.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?

Modularity in software design is aimed at creating software in a way that minimizes dependencies of a system.

It improves maintainabilty because changes do not affect others,thus making bugs easier to track down and fix without risking other parts of the system. It can be scaled more readily by adding new modules without impacting the rest of the system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?

Unit testing: is the process of testing individual units.
Integration testing: is the process of testing interconnected units.
System testing: is the process of testing the software as a whole.
Acceptance testing: is the process of testing for acceptability.

Testing in software development is imperative, as it identifies any issues and defects with the written code so they can be fixed before the software product is delivered.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.

Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. 
It is important for keeping track of changes to code,files,and other digital assets, e.g.
Git:Branching, Security, Distributed computing,Tracks history,Compatability,Commit graphs

Bitbucket:Jira-integration, Merge checks, Deployment permissions, Automate deployments

Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?

Software project management serves as liasons betweenthe development team and the stakeholders in a software project. 
Ensures timely delivery,Cost control,Quality assurance,Resource management,Risk management,Stakeholder satisfaction.
Challenges faced are time constraints. Misalignment between goals and business objectives.

Software Maintenance:


Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?

Software maintenance is the modification of a software product after delivery. 

Corrective maintenance is a type of software maintenance that focusses on identifying and fixing defects or bugs in a software product.

Adaptive maintenance is usually done when the environment of your software hanges.

Performative maintenance ivolves making changes to the software to improve its performance.

Preventive maintenance is done to prevent potential system vulnerabilities.


Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?

Engineers working under pressure to meet deadlines for the deployment of products,mostly resulting in faulty products that need to be debugged and go through quality control before beinf deployed again,therefore running way behind schedule.

Making decisions on which bugs to fix and how quickly,ensuring quality of the code before release.


Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
